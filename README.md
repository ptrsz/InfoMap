# InfoMap
Web application to show geographical objects (nodes) with status and info properties on a map, in a web browser.

#Hi.
This application is a demostration of my skills, and the capabilities of the leaflet + osm applications together. This is just a demo, many features are hidden and undeveloped yet.

Feel free to ask!
